Spanish Flashcard Congugation Quiz Web App
CSD 122

The application I am building will be a series of flashcards 
each card will have a Spanish sentence on it with a blank space for the verb
the infinitive (base) of the verb will be provided
the user must type in the correct conjugation of the verb based on the grammar in the rest of the sentence
spaced repetition recall is one of the best ways that people learn information
I hope to use this application to teach myself and others correct Spanish grammar (one of the hardest parts of the language)!

note: I am not very framiliar with React, and I will submit a more detailed plan once I have had time to learn more about the framework
for now, here is a rough outline of what I want to do...

tech specifications:
	* use React JavaScript to create web based applicaiton
	* use a MySQL database back end (wrote database for this app as part of a previous class project)
		* will need restful API to communicate with database

minimum viable functionality:
	* show flashcard to user
		* display sentence with blank spot for verb to be conjugated
	* allow user to type in a solution
		* check solution 
		* let user know if their answer was right or wrong

bonus functionality:
	* keep track of which answers the user gets right or wrong
		* will use to quiz user more or less
	* add hint functionality to give user advise if they are stuck
	* implement some unit testing
	
task will require:
	* learn basic GitHub commands to manage project
	* set up IDE (VisualStudio possibly?)
	* learn React
		* go through basic tutorials
	* learn about restful api
	* re-learn MySQL database project
	* create final presentation with lessons learned
